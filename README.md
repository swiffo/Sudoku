# Sudoku
Sudoku - the ancient Japanese art of wasting time by putting numbers in a grid.

The code implements a solver for the more basic puzzles. It works entirely by elimination of possibilities. 
Puzzles with multiple solutions will leave it nonplussed.

There is no interface for interacting with the solver. It simples runs on the one example it knows (stolen from some article).
